# IntToStr-by-Sintrode
IntToStr is a script that converts integers to their word equivalents. 1000 becomes one thousand, 256 becomes two hundred and fifty-six, and so forth. Coming in at just over 6KB, this script is mostly comments and some hard-coded arrays. A previous version of the script dynamically generated the arrays, but the script took three times as long to run.
